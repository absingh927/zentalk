  - Depending on the technology chosen, the setup can be time consuming and architecting in a way that can be expanded on.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?
I think the design is a good starting point and has some of the essential elements there. I would add more spacing and background color to show greater seperation of flow. So the user knows their current article, current position within the main flow of the app. I would also add the date and time articles and comments were posted so user knows the current status of the information they are seeing.
